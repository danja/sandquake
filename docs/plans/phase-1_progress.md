- Complete UI with controls, canvas, and info display
- Keyboard controls operational (arrows for camera, shortcuts for speed/sources)

### Key Features Working
- Sand sources dropping sand at configurable rates
- Abelian sandpile avalanche mechanics
- 3D visualization with camera controls
- Real-time speed adjustment (0-5x)
- Dynamic source management (add/remove)
- Visual feedback for all interactions

## Testing Status üß™

### Manual Testing Completed
- ‚úÖ Application startup and initialization
- ‚úÖ Camera panning and tilting with arrow keys
- ‚úÖ Speed control with slider and keyboard shortcuts
- ‚úÖ Source management with buttons and shortcuts
- ‚úÖ 3D scene rendering and lighting
- ‚úÖ Responsive design and window resizing

### Areas Needing Testing
- [ ] Long-running simulation stability
- [ ] Large avalanche performance
- [ ] Edge cases (maximum sources, zero speed)
- [ ] Memory usage over time
- [ ] Browser compatibility

## Performance Metrics üìä

### Rendering Performance
- Target: 60 FPS with smooth camera movement
- Sand renderer: Optimized updates every 2 frames
- Memory management: Proper disposal of Three.js objects

### Simulation Performance  
- Grid size: 64x64 cells
- Avalanche processing: Limited to 5 iterations per frame
- Source updates: Frame-rate independent timing

## Bug Fixes üîß

### Fixed Issues
- ‚úÖ **Source Control Synchronization**: Fixed issue where SourcesControl wasn't synchronized with Simulation's initial source count, causing "Add Source" button to appear non-functional initially
- ‚úÖ **Camera Initialization Error**: Fixed `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'updateAspect')` error by reordering Scene constructor to initialize camera before calling handleResize()
- ‚úÖ **Sources Display Synchronization**: Fixed conflicting DOM updates between main.js and SourcesControl that caused sources count to display incorrectly

## Known Issues üêõ

### Minor Issues
- Source markers could be more visually distinct
- Sand rendering could benefit from instanced meshes for better performance
- Avalanche visualization could be more dramatic

### Future Enhancements
- Add visual effects for avalanches
- Implement level-of-detail for large simulations
- Add save/load functionality for simulation states
- Include simulation statistics display

## Next Steps üìã

1. **Testing & Polish** (In Progress)
   - Set up automated testing framework
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Performance optimization testing

2. **Documentation** (Pending)
   - Generate complete JSDoc documentation  
   - Update README with usage instructions
   - Create developer documentation

3. **Advanced Features** (Future)
   - Statistics dashboard
   - Simulation presets
   - Export capabilities

## Summary

Phase 1 implementation is **95% complete** with all core functionality working. The 3D sandpile simulation successfully demonstrates the Abelian sandpile model with intuitive controls and smooth visualization. Ready for testing and final polish.
