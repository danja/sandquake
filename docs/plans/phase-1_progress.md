- [ ] Memory usage over time
- [ ] Browser compatibility

## Performance Metrics üìä

### Rendering Performance
- Target: 60 FPS with smooth camera movement
- Sand renderer: Optimized updates every 2 frames
- Memory management: Proper disposal of Three.js objects

### Simulation Performance  
- Grid size: 64x64 cells
- Avalanche processing: Limited to 5 iterations per frame
- Source updates: Frame-rate independent timing

## Bug Fixes üîß

### Fixed Issues
- ‚úÖ **Source Control Synchronization**: Fixed issue where SourcesControl wasn't synchronized with Simulation's initial source count, causing "Add Source" button to appear non-functional initially
- ‚úÖ **Camera Initialization Error**: Fixed `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'updateAspect')` error by reordering Scene constructor to initialize camera before calling handleResize()
- ‚úÖ **Sources Display Synchronization**: Fixed conflicting DOM updates between main.js and SourcesControl that caused sources count to display incorrectly
- ‚úÖ **Canvas Rendering Issue**: Fixed canvas element not filling its container by adding missing CSS styles (`width: 100%; height: 100%; display: block;`)
- ‚úÖ **KeyboardHandler Event Listener Errors**: Fixed memory leaks and console errors by properly binding event handlers and implementing correct disposal pattern
- ‚úÖ **Camera Control API Mismatch**: Fixed arrow key controls by using correct Scene.getCamera() method and proper parameter passing to Camera.pan()/tilt() methods
- ‚úÖ **HeatmapRenderer Grid Access Error**: Fixed `sandPile.getGrid is not a function` error by using correct SandPile.getGridCopy() method

## Known Issues üêõ

### Minor Issues
- Source markers could be more visually distinct
- Sand rendering could benefit from instanced meshes for better performance
- Avalanche visualization could be more dramatic

### Future Enhancements
- Add visual effects for avalanches
